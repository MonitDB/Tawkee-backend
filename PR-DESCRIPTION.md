# Authentication Flow Improvements

## Overview
This PR fixes several issues in the authentication flow, including registration, login, logout functionality, and improves the OAuth user experience.

## Changes

### Registration Endpoint
- Fixed the registration controller to properly return both user data and token
- Added improved error handling and logging during user creation
- Ensured the response structure is consistent with the login endpoint

### Logout Functionality
- Fixed token blacklisting to correctly include the userId field
- Added better error handling and transaction management
- Improved logging during the logout process

### User Profile Access
- Fixed the auth guard to properly extract and validate the userId from JWT tokens
- Added better validation in the findOne method to ensure the ID is properly provided
- Improved error handling when accessing user profiles

### OAuth Authentication
- Improved error handling for OAuth users attempting password login
- Added clear error messages directing users to use the correct authentication method
- Fixed Facebook OAuth cancellation handling to properly redirect to frontend

## Testing
Added comprehensive test scripts to verify the authentication flow:
- `test-register-login-logout.js`: Tests the complete authentication flow from registration to logout
- `test-oauth-login-error.js`: Tests specific error handling for OAuth users
- `create-test-oauth-user.js`: Utility script to create test OAuth users

## Technical Details
- Used proper transaction handling for database operations
- Added consistent error handling throughout the authentication flow
- Improved logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Fixed JWT token handling in the AuthGuard

## Next Steps
- Consider adding refresh token functionality for longer-lived sessions
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
